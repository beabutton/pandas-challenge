The analysis is one that I am sure is utalized currently in our education system to determine funding as well as to determine successful vs failing schools. While it provides useful data it is nothing without the context of the local and socioeconomic status of the students and families associated with each school. When comparing the score differences between charter and district schools it looks as if the charter schools are significantly more successful, they very well may be, but it is just raw data which needs to be analysied through the lens of culture. I hold a BA in anthropology and find it rather difficult to make blanket infrences about the data in relation to conculsions. I am able to objectivly compare numbers and say on face level things appear to tell one story. For example, small and medium school sizes yeilded better passing rates than large schools which supports other data regarding classroom size. With relativly similar per student budgets across the board it is rather interesting this was a point of comparason as there is no budget breakdown. Just because there is approvimatly 600 dollars per student per school does not mean it is spent the same way, rather to say it is spent on teaching reading and math. Overall I found this very interesting once I pushed the social scientist side of me down for wanting more information and more data. 




I encountered multiple fatal errors I was unable to fix one of them involving the school type. No matter what I tried it would not work until I worked through it with AskBCS LA Sean. He was SO helpful and we got everything working. I had over formatted my work which kicked two different errors.
